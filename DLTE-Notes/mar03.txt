Testing DAO,SOAP,servlet(refer nores for more)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

 2While implementation of CRUD---------methods that return nothing(void) .....like save,update,delete.........using verify method of testing.

			|===========methods the return something(like int,float..)......................using assertions method of testing. 				     
=>testing requires two dependencies--------junit

SOAP
---------------------------
-------------------------wsimport -keep url?wsdl
The wsimport command is a tool provided by the Java Development Kit (JDK) for generating Java classes based on a given WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file. WSDL is an XML format used to describe web services and their functionality.

-keep: This option tells wsimport to retain the generated source files. By default, wsimport generates the necessary Java files and compiles them into class files, discarding the source files. The -keep option preserves the generated source files, allowing you to inspect them and make modifications if needed.

WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is a standardized XML format used to describe the functionality offered by a web service. It serves as a contract between the service provider and the service consumer, defining how the service can be accessed and what operations it supports. 


--------------------------

>SOAP: SOAP is a protocol that follows a strict standard for communication between client and server. It uses XML for message format and works with Web Services Description Language (WSDL).

>REST: REST is an architectural style, not a protocol. It doesnâ€™t follow strict standards but adheres to six constraints defined by Roy Fielding. REST uses various media types (e.g., XML, JSON) and operates over HTTP.


SERVLET
--------
>Servlet technology is used to create a web application (resides at server side and generates a dynamic web page).
>Servlet is a class that extends the capabilities of the servers and responds to the incoming requests. It can respond to any requests.Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.
>The javax.servlet package contains many interfaces and classes that are used by the servlet or web container. 


Standup questions:
-----------------------------
-----------------------------

>>>Is jboss a web server or an applcation server?

JBoss application server is an open-source platform, developed by Red Hat, used for implementing Java applications and a wide variety of other software applications. 
While JBoss includes features for serving web applications, such as HTTP and servlet support,

A web server primarily handles static content (such as HTML files, images, and CSS) and responds to HTTP requests from clients (usually web browsers).
In web server, HTML and HTTP protocols are used.

An application server is more versatile and handles dynamic content. It executes business logic, interacts with databases, and generates dynamic responses.(manages servlets and jsp)
While in this, GUI as well as HTTP and RPC/RMI protocols are used.


>>>Explain the life cycle of servlets with an example.


>>>In the HttpServlet class, the init() method is invoked during which phase ?


>>>What happens if we invoke init method for the second time or multiple times?


>>>What is the diffence between init and destroy methods ?


>>>Other than HttpServlet class are there any other inbuilt classes which gives same functionality.

in case of http specific functionality we use httpservelet(from javax.servlet.http package) for response and request tracking but in case of non-http(like ftp,smtp taks..) taks other class like GenericServlet(from javax.servlet package) are used.
GenericServlet: It provides service() method, which is protocol-independent and must be overridden by subclasses to handle requests.
HttpServlet: It provides specific methods like doGet(), doPost(), doPut(), doDelete(), etc., corresponding to HTTP methods
